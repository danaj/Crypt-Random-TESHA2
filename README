Crypt::Random::TESHA2 version 0.01
========================

Crypt::Random::TESHA2 produces "userspace voodoo entropy" for people that
do not have or don't want to use O/S supplied sources.  It uses timing
differences between sleeps to generate entropy, which is mixed using SHA256,
then fed to an entropy pool using SHA512 (or SHA256 for systems with no SHA512
support), which collects the mix and sends it out.

If you want strong cryptography, use /dev/random.
If you're having issues with /dev/random blocking, run HAVEGED.
On Win32, use CryptGenRandom.

If, however, you want something in userspace to seed a CSPRNG like
Math::Random::ISAAC, then this could work for you.  If your system
doesn't have /dev/random and you've verified this module works on
your system, then this could be the answer.

There are similarities between the concepts here and TrueRand 2.1, though
that module did not influence the design or implementation of this.  The
version of TrueRand used in Math::TrulyRandom is old.
